# Data Journalism and D3

Summary

The project aims to understand health risks facing particular demographics by examining information from the U.S. Census Bureau and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System and creating visualizations using D3.

Source of Data

Visualizations

Using the D3 techniques, a scatter plot is created between two of the data variables Smokers vs. Age each circle elements representing each state. This graphic is coded in the app.js file with data from data.csv by using the d3.csv function.
